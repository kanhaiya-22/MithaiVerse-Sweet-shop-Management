I am building a full-stack Sweet Shop Management System exactly according to the requirements provided in the attached PDF. Please read and understand the entire PDF thoroughly, and then help me generate clean, production-ready code following Test-Driven Development (TDD). The backend must be built using Node.js with TypeScript and Express, connected to a real MongoDB database (not in-memory), and must implement JWT-based authentication with user registration, login, password hashing, and protected routes. You must create all the required REST API endpoints including user auth, CRUD operations for sweets, search functionality, and inventory management actions like purchase and restock (with admin-only restrictions). Each sweet must contain a unique ID, name, category, price, and quantity. The project architecture should follow SOLID principles, consist of separate folders for controllers, services, routes, models, middleware, config, and tests, and all logic should be modular, reusable, and cleanly organized. All backend development must follow proper TDD using Jest and Supertest, ensuring a clear Red-Green-Refactor pattern with meaningful test cases and high coverage. For the frontend, generate a modern React (TypeScript) single-page application with pages for user registration, login, dashboard, sweet listing, search and filtering, purchase button that disables at zero quantity, and admin-only UI for adding, updating, deleting, and restocking sweets. Use React Router for navigation, Axios for API integration, Context API (or Redux) for authentication state, and create a clean, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS. Ensure proper error handling, loading states, and form validations across all features. Also help generate a complete README.md file including project overview, installation steps for both backend and frontend, environment variable setup, running tests, screenshots sections, and a dedicated “My AI Usage” section describing how Copilot assisted in development. Start by generating the backend folder structure, package.json, and initial test files for authentication following TDD before writing the actual implementation.
